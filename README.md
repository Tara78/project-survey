# Survey form with React
This is a survey app with React. I used the useState hook in React. 

This survey application has 8 components. All components are imported to the app.js. 
In the introduction, explains the survey and how it looks like, and each section what is about. 
With the radio buttons & selected dropdown  questions to choose the option. 

- With next and previous button user can go to the next page or back and change the previous page if there is a need to change. There is a summary page that shows the whole summary of the survey.

## The problem
That was not easy to move on to the next page which I solved it by creating a function on the app.jsx and give a order. 

If i have more time i would work more on validation part. EX.put error message and use red color for error . 

# How to run the App
npm start
