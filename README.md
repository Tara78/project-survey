# Survey form with React
This is a survey app with React. I used the useState hook in React. 
In ordet to Start the project: npm start. 

In the survey app, with 8 components. All components are imported to the app. 
In the introduction, explains the survey and how it looks like, and each section what is about. 
I used radio buttons & selected dropdown for questions to choose the option. 
I made two buttons (next and previous) button the person can go back and change the previous page if there is a need to change. 
I made a summary page that shows the whole summary of the survey. 

## The problem

That was not easy to move on to the next page which I 
solve it by creating a function on the app.jsx and give a order. 


If i have more time i would work more on validation part. EX.put error message and use red color for error .
